**Bank Analytics Repository**


Welcome to the Bank Analytics Repository, a comprehensive collection of analytics work focused on bank data related to loans and customer segmentation. This repository is divided into four phases, each focusing on different aspects of data analytics and visualization. The four phases include:

1.Excel Work on Data and Dashboard Creation
2.SQL KPI Extraction
3.Power BI Dashboard Development
4.Tableau Dashboard Creation


1. Excel Work on Data and Dashboard Creation
In this phase, we have worked on analyzing and cleaning the bank data related to loans and customer types using Excel. Various data manipulation techniques have been applied to prepare the data for visualization. Additionally, we have created interactive dashboards in Excel to provide an overview of key metrics and trends.

2. SQL KPI Extraction
The SQL KPI Extraction phase involves extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) from the bank data using SQL queries. By querying the database, we aim to identify important metrics related to loan performance, customer behavior, and other relevant insights that can drive decision-making within the bank.

3. Power BI Dashboard Development
In the Power BI Dashboard Development phase, we have leveraged Microsoft Power BI to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that showcase the analyzed bank data. Through Power BI's powerful data visualization capabilities, we aim to provide stakeholders with actionable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making processes.

4. Tableau Dashboard Creation
The Tableau Dashboard Creation phase focuses on building dynamic and informative dashboards using Tableau software. By visualizing the bank data in Tableau, we aim to present advanced analytics and visualizations that highlight trends, patterns, and outliers within the data, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.

Feel free to explore each phase of the Bank Analytics Repository to gain a deeper understanding of the analytics work conducted on bank data related to loans and customer segmentation. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
